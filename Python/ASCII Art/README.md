In This project, we’re going to have an image that we will render into ASCIII, every image contains pixels, and we’re going to represent each of these pixels using an ASCII charcter. For example if we have a dark background with a bright white text.
- Dark pixels will be represented by small characters like a dot `.`
- Bright ones will be represented by a dense charcter like `$` to fill the screen

A small image ($480 \times 680$) or a little bigger is recommended

The Python library `Pillow` (`PIL`) is being used, to install simply execute:

```sh
pip install pillow
```
